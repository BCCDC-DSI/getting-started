# Starting new Python project at the centre

## Clone from an existing GitHub repository 

To illustrate, clone from a repo containing Python code (previously prepared by your peers)

1. Work on ```C:``` drive (network drives U and O appear to be slower)
  ```
  cd C:\Users\user.name\DSI\
  ```

2. To illustrate, we will use the RADD consult as an example:
  ```
  git clone -b pt2 https://github.com/BCCDC-DSI/RADD.git
  ```

3. We'll try out the Python code under ```part2_version2```
  ```
  cd C:\Users\user.name\DSI\RADD\workflows\part2_version2\
  ```

4. Create new virtual environment named radd-p2
  ```
  python -m venv radd-p2
  ```

5. Activate it:
  ```
  radd-p2\Scripts\activate
  ```

6. Build the virtual environment by download packages specified in the ```requirementsWindows.txt```
  ```
  pip install -r requirementsWindows.txt
  ```

7. Try executing one Python script created for this project:
  ```
  python create_dataset.py
  ```
